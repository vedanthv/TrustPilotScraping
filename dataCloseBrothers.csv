I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!


Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience. We'd like to look into the matter further for you both and for you to have an opportunity to discuss your concerns in more detail. If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.

Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude. They also have no problem charging you late fees * but when they are late to the out a payment we don't get any money back? Absolute scammers.	1
AVOID!!! CLOSE BROTHERS ARE THE WORST FINANCE COMPANY OUT THERE!! CROOKS!!	Do not use close brothers they are the worst scammers ever, the worst finance company you can use. They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy.

This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!


Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience. We'd like to look into the matter further for you both and for you to have an opportunity to discuss your concerns in more detail. If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.  Now having to employ a solicitor to get them to speak to us. I'm being over generous with 1 star!!!"	1

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

My surprise was when I realised after 2months they can not take payments from my friend account soo they used my card details to take the payments from my personal account. This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.
Unfortunately Trustpilot dont allow -10stars😡

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude. They also have no problem charging you late fees * but when they are late to the out a payment we don't get any money back? Absolute scammers.	1
AVOID!!! CLOSE BROTHERS ARE THE WORST FINANCE COMPANY OUT THERE!! CROOKS!!	Do not use close brothers they are the worst scammers ever, the worst finance company you can use. They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy.

I give my debit card details to take the first payment for car insurance.
My surprise was when I realised after 2months they can not take payments from my friend account soo they used my card details to take the payments from my personal account. This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint.

Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience. We'd like to look into the matter further for you both and for you to have an opportunity to discuss your concerns in more detail. If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.  Now having to employ a solicitor to get them to speak to us. I'm being over generous with 1 star!!!"	1

Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude. They also have no problem charging you late fees * but when they are late to the out a payment we don't get any money back? Absolute scammers.	1
AVOID!!! CLOSE BROTHERS ARE THE WORST FINANCE COMPANY OUT THERE!! CROOKS!!	Do not use close brothers they are the worst scammers ever, the worst finance company you can use. They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy.

I give my debit card details to take the first payment for car insurance.
My surprise was when I realised after 2months they can not take payments from my friend account soo they used my card details to take the payments from my personal account. This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

You have made my life and my wife’s life unbearable through threatening behaviour via “cancellation of the contract and  repossession of the vehicle”

Because you don’t want to repair it 

You disgust me I don’t have enough words to say how much your business practice has destroyed my life 
With all of the stress I had a stroke 
You knew my wife is really poorly and you still used against me as you knew I needed the car to take her to Christie’s for her cancer treatment 
So thank you for taking what should of been time spent with my wife enjoying what time we had left together and destroying it 
I hope people read this and decide not to destroy there life as well

Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude.

They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy.

I give my debit card details to take the first payment for car insurance.

This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!


Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience.

If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!


Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience. We'd like to look into the matter further for you both and for you to have an opportunity to discuss your concerns in more detail. If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.  Now having to employ a solicitor to get them to speak to us. I'm being over generous with 1 star!!!"	1
Never ever trust this company they are…	"Never ever trust this company they are very devious under handed and completely untrustworthy 
You have lied,cheated,altered your own records to make yourselves look good to the ombudsman and the courts 
I have got some of the transcripts of the phone calls

Tried to make me look like I was intimidating your staff 
(You rang me I only answered the phone call)
You have made my life a living hell for over 24 months
You have made my life and my wife’s life unbearable through threatening behaviour via “cancellation of the contract and  repossession of the vehicle”
If I won’t return the vehicle 
Because you don’t want to repair it 

You disgust me I don’t have enough words to say how much your business practice has destroyed my life 
With all of the stress I had a stroke 
You knew my wife is really poorly and you still used against me as you knew I needed the car to take her to Christie’s for her cancer treatment 
So thank you for taking what should of been time spent with my wife enjoying what time we had left together and destroying it 
I hope people read this and decide not to destroy there life as well

Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude. They also have no problem charging you late fees * but when they are late to the out a payment we don't get any money back? Absolute scammers.	1
AVOID!!! CLOSE BROTHERS ARE THE WORST FINANCE COMPANY OUT THERE!! CROOKS!!	Do not use close brothers they are the worst scammers ever, the worst finance company you can use. They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy. But however they think it is fine to take a higher amount when my insurance quote was recalculated and dropped substantially. Ended up just paying it off in full so these slime balls don't take any more money off	1

I've help a friend of mine sort the car insurance with this group.
I give my debit card details to take the first payment for car insurance.
My surprise was when I realised after 2months they can not take payments from my friend account soo they used my card details to take the payments from my personal account. This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

You have made my life and my wife’s life unbearable through threatening behaviour via “cancellation of the contract and  repossession of the vehicle”

Because you don’t want to repair it 

You disgust me I don’t have enough words to say how much your business practice has destroyed my life 
With all of the stress I had a stroke 
You knew my wife is really poorly and you still used against me as you knew I needed the car to take her to Christie’s for her cancer treatment 
So thank you for taking what should of been time spent with my wife enjoying what time we had left together and destroying it 
I hope people read this and decide not to destroy there life as well

Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude.

They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy.

I give my debit card details to take the first payment for car insurance.

This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!


Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience.

If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!


Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience. We'd like to look into the matter further for you both and for you to have an opportunity to discuss your concerns in more detail. If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.  Now having to employ a solicitor to get them to speak to us. I'm being over generous with 1 star!!!"	1
Never ever trust this company they are…	"Never ever trust this company they are very devious under handed and completely untrustworthy 
You have lied,cheated,altered your own records to make yourselves look good to the ombudsman and the courts 
I have got some of the transcripts of the phone calls

Tried to make me look like I was intimidating your staff 
(You rang me I only answered the phone call)
You have made my life a living hell for over 24 months
You have made my life and my wife’s life unbearable through threatening behaviour via “cancellation of the contract and  repossession of the vehicle”
If I won’t return the vehicle 
Because you don’t want to repair it 

You disgust me I don’t have enough words to say how much your business practice has destroyed my life 
With all of the stress I had a stroke 
You knew my wife is really poorly and you still used against me as you knew I needed the car to take her to Christie’s for her cancer treatment 
So thank you for taking what should of been time spent with my wife enjoying what time we had left together and destroying it 
I hope people read this and decide not to destroy there life as well

Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude. They also have no problem charging you late fees * but when they are late to the out a payment we don't get any money back? Absolute scammers.	1
AVOID!!! CLOSE BROTHERS ARE THE WORST FINANCE COMPANY OUT THERE!! CROOKS!!	Do not use close brothers they are the worst scammers ever, the worst finance company you can use. They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy. But however they think it is fine to take a higher amount when my insurance quote was recalculated and dropped substantially. Ended up just paying it off in full so these slime balls don't take any more money off	1

I've help a friend of mine sort the car insurance with this group.
I give my debit card details to take the first payment for car insurance.
My surprise was when I realised after 2months they can not take payments from my friend account soo they used my card details to take the payments from my personal account. This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

You have made my life and my wife’s life unbearable through threatening behaviour via “cancellation of the contract and  repossession of the vehicle”

Because you don’t want to repair it 

You disgust me I don’t have enough words to say how much your business practice has destroyed my life 
With all of the stress I had a stroke 
You knew my wife is really poorly and you still used against me as you knew I needed the car to take her to Christie’s for her cancer treatment 
So thank you for taking what should of been time spent with my wife enjoying what time we had left together and destroying it 
I hope people read this and decide not to destroy there life as well

Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude.

They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy.

I give my debit card details to take the first payment for car insurance.

This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!


Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience.

If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!


Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience. We'd like to look into the matter further for you both and for you to have an opportunity to discuss your concerns in more detail. If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.  Now having to employ a solicitor to get them to speak to us. I'm being over generous with 1 star!!!"	1
Never ever trust this company they are…	"Never ever trust this company they are very devious under handed and completely untrustworthy 
You have lied,cheated,altered your own records to make yourselves look good to the ombudsman and the courts 
I have got some of the transcripts of the phone calls

Tried to make me look like I was intimidating your staff 
(You rang me I only answered the phone call)
You have made my life a living hell for over 24 months
You have made my life and my wife’s life unbearable through threatening behaviour via “cancellation of the contract and  repossession of the vehicle”
If I won’t return the vehicle 
Because you don’t want to repair it 

You disgust me I don’t have enough words to say how much your business practice has destroyed my life 
With all of the stress I had a stroke 
You knew my wife is really poorly and you still used against me as you knew I needed the car to take her to Christie’s for her cancer treatment 
So thank you for taking what should of been time spent with my wife enjoying what time we had left together and destroying it 
I hope people read this and decide not to destroy there life as well

Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude. They also have no problem charging you late fees * but when they are late to the out a payment we don't get any money back? Absolute scammers.	1
AVOID!!! CLOSE BROTHERS ARE THE WORST FINANCE COMPANY OUT THERE!! CROOKS!!	Do not use close brothers they are the worst scammers ever, the worst finance company you can use. They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy. But however they think it is fine to take a higher amount when my insurance quote was recalculated and dropped substantially. Ended up just paying it off in full so these slime balls don't take any more money off	1

I've help a friend of mine sort the car insurance with this group.
I give my debit card details to take the first payment for car insurance.
My surprise was when I realised after 2months they can not take payments from my friend account soo they used my card details to take the payments from my personal account. This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

You have made my life and my wife’s life unbearable through threatening behaviour via “cancellation of the contract and  repossession of the vehicle”

Because you don’t want to repair it 

You disgust me I don’t have enough words to say how much your business practice has destroyed my life 
With all of the stress I had a stroke 
You knew my wife is really poorly and you still used against me as you knew I needed the car to take her to Christie’s for her cancer treatment 
So thank you for taking what should of been time spent with my wife enjoying what time we had left together and destroying it 
I hope people read this and decide not to destroy there life as well

Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude.

They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy.

I give my debit card details to take the first payment for car insurance.

This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!


Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience.

If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!


Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience. We'd like to look into the matter further for you both and for you to have an opportunity to discuss your concerns in more detail. If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.  Now having to employ a solicitor to get them to speak to us. I'm being over generous with 1 star!!!"	1
Never ever trust this company they are…	"Never ever trust this company they are very devious under handed and completely untrustworthy 
You have lied,cheated,altered your own records to make yourselves look good to the ombudsman and the courts 
I have got some of the transcripts of the phone calls

Tried to make me look like I was intimidating your staff 
(You rang me I only answered the phone call)
You have made my life a living hell for over 24 months
You have made my life and my wife’s life unbearable through threatening behaviour via “cancellation of the contract and  repossession of the vehicle”
If I won’t return the vehicle 
Because you don’t want to repair it 

You disgust me I don’t have enough words to say how much your business practice has destroyed my life 
With all of the stress I had a stroke 
You knew my wife is really poorly and you still used against me as you knew I needed the car to take her to Christie’s for her cancer treatment 
So thank you for taking what should of been time spent with my wife enjoying what time we had left together and destroying it 
I hope people read this and decide not to destroy there life as well

Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude. They also have no problem charging you late fees * but when they are late to the out a payment we don't get any money back? Absolute scammers.	1
AVOID!!! CLOSE BROTHERS ARE THE WORST FINANCE COMPANY OUT THERE!! CROOKS!!	Do not use close brothers they are the worst scammers ever, the worst finance company you can use. They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy. But however they think it is fine to take a higher amount when my insurance quote was recalculated and dropped substantially. Ended up just paying it off in full so these slime balls don't take any more money off	1

I've help a friend of mine sort the car insurance with this group.
I give my debit card details to take the first payment for car insurance.
My surprise was when I realised after 2months they can not take payments from my friend account soo they used my card details to take the payments from my personal account. This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

You have made my life and my wife’s life unbearable through threatening behaviour via “cancellation of the contract and  repossession of the vehicle”

Because you don’t want to repair it 

You disgust me I don’t have enough words to say how much your business practice has destroyed my life 
With all of the stress I had a stroke 
You knew my wife is really poorly and you still used against me as you knew I needed the car to take her to Christie’s for her cancer treatment 
So thank you for taking what should of been time spent with my wife enjoying what time we had left together and destroying it 
I hope people read this and decide not to destroy there life as well

Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude.

They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy.

I give my debit card details to take the first payment for car insurance.

This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!


Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience.

If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!


Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience. We'd like to look into the matter further for you both and for you to have an opportunity to discuss your concerns in more detail. If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.  Now having to employ a solicitor to get them to speak to us. I'm being over generous with 1 star!!!"	1
Never ever trust this company they are…	"Never ever trust this company they are very devious under handed and completely untrustworthy 
You have lied,cheated,altered your own records to make yourselves look good to the ombudsman and the courts 
I have got some of the transcripts of the phone calls

Tried to make me look like I was intimidating your staff 
(You rang me I only answered the phone call)
You have made my life a living hell for over 24 months
You have made my life and my wife’s life unbearable through threatening behaviour via “cancellation of the contract and  repossession of the vehicle”
If I won’t return the vehicle 
Because you don’t want to repair it 

You disgust me I don’t have enough words to say how much your business practice has destroyed my life 
With all of the stress I had a stroke 
You knew my wife is really poorly and you still used against me as you knew I needed the car to take her to Christie’s for her cancer treatment 
So thank you for taking what should of been time spent with my wife enjoying what time we had left together and destroying it 
I hope people read this and decide not to destroy there life as well

Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude. They also have no problem charging you late fees * but when they are late to the out a payment we don't get any money back? Absolute scammers.	1
AVOID!!! CLOSE BROTHERS ARE THE WORST FINANCE COMPANY OUT THERE!! CROOKS!!	Do not use close brothers they are the worst scammers ever, the worst finance company you can use. They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy. But however they think it is fine to take a higher amount when my insurance quote was recalculated and dropped substantially. Ended up just paying it off in full so these slime balls don't take any more money off	1

I've help a friend of mine sort the car insurance with this group.
I give my debit card details to take the first payment for car insurance.
My surprise was when I realised after 2months they can not take payments from my friend account soo they used my card details to take the payments from my personal account. This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

You have made my life and my wife’s life unbearable through threatening behaviour via “cancellation of the contract and  repossession of the vehicle”

Because you don’t want to repair it 

You disgust me I don’t have enough words to say how much your business practice has destroyed my life 
With all of the stress I had a stroke 
You knew my wife is really poorly and you still used against me as you knew I needed the car to take her to Christie’s for her cancer treatment 
So thank you for taking what should of been time spent with my wife enjoying what time we had left together and destroying it 
I hope people read this and decide not to destroy there life as well

Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude.

They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy.

I give my debit card details to take the first payment for car insurance.

This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!


Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience.

If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!


Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience. We'd like to look into the matter further for you both and for you to have an opportunity to discuss your concerns in more detail. If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.  Now having to employ a solicitor to get them to speak to us. I'm being over generous with 1 star!!!"	1
Never ever trust this company they are…	"Never ever trust this company they are very devious under handed and completely untrustworthy 
You have lied,cheated,altered your own records to make yourselves look good to the ombudsman and the courts 
I have got some of the transcripts of the phone calls

Tried to make me look like I was intimidating your staff 
(You rang me I only answered the phone call)
You have made my life a living hell for over 24 months
You have made my life and my wife’s life unbearable through threatening behaviour via “cancellation of the contract and  repossession of the vehicle”
If I won’t return the vehicle 
Because you don’t want to repair it 

You disgust me I don’t have enough words to say how much your business practice has destroyed my life 
With all of the stress I had a stroke 
You knew my wife is really poorly and you still used against me as you knew I needed the car to take her to Christie’s for her cancer treatment 
So thank you for taking what should of been time spent with my wife enjoying what time we had left together and destroying it 
I hope people read this and decide not to destroy there life as well

Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude. They also have no problem charging you late fees * but when they are late to the out a payment we don't get any money back? Absolute scammers.	1
AVOID!!! CLOSE BROTHERS ARE THE WORST FINANCE COMPANY OUT THERE!! CROOKS!!	Do not use close brothers they are the worst scammers ever, the worst finance company you can use. They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy. But however they think it is fine to take a higher amount when my insurance quote was recalculated and dropped substantially. Ended up just paying it off in full so these slime balls don't take any more money off	1

I've help a friend of mine sort the car insurance with this group.
I give my debit card details to take the first payment for car insurance.
My surprise was when I realised after 2months they can not take payments from my friend account soo they used my card details to take the payments from my personal account. This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

You have made my life and my wife’s life unbearable through threatening behaviour via “cancellation of the contract and  repossession of the vehicle”

Because you don’t want to repair it 

You disgust me I don’t have enough words to say how much your business practice has destroyed my life 
With all of the stress I had a stroke 
You knew my wife is really poorly and you still used against me as you knew I needed the car to take her to Christie’s for her cancer treatment 
So thank you for taking what should of been time spent with my wife enjoying what time we had left together and destroying it 
I hope people read this and decide not to destroy there life as well

Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude.

They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy.

I give my debit card details to take the first payment for car insurance.

This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!


Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience.

If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!


Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience. We'd like to look into the matter further for you both and for you to have an opportunity to discuss your concerns in more detail. If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.  Now having to employ a solicitor to get them to speak to us. I'm being over generous with 1 star!!!"	1
Never ever trust this company they are…	"Never ever trust this company they are very devious under handed and completely untrustworthy 
You have lied,cheated,altered your own records to make yourselves look good to the ombudsman and the courts 
I have got some of the transcripts of the phone calls

Tried to make me look like I was intimidating your staff 
(You rang me I only answered the phone call)
You have made my life a living hell for over 24 months
You have made my life and my wife’s life unbearable through threatening behaviour via “cancellation of the contract and  repossession of the vehicle”
If I won’t return the vehicle 
Because you don’t want to repair it 

You disgust me I don’t have enough words to say how much your business practice has destroyed my life 
With all of the stress I had a stroke 
You knew my wife is really poorly and you still used against me as you knew I needed the car to take her to Christie’s for her cancer treatment 
So thank you for taking what should of been time spent with my wife enjoying what time we had left together and destroying it 
I hope people read this and decide not to destroy there life as well

Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude. They also have no problem charging you late fees * but when they are late to the out a payment we don't get any money back? Absolute scammers.	1
AVOID!!! CLOSE BROTHERS ARE THE WORST FINANCE COMPANY OUT THERE!! CROOKS!!	Do not use close brothers they are the worst scammers ever, the worst finance company you can use. They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy. But however they think it is fine to take a higher amount when my insurance quote was recalculated and dropped substantially. Ended up just paying it off in full so these slime balls don't take any more money off	1

I've help a friend of mine sort the car insurance with this group.
I give my debit card details to take the first payment for car insurance.
My surprise was when I realised after 2months they can not take payments from my friend account soo they used my card details to take the payments from my personal account. This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

You have made my life and my wife’s life unbearable through threatening behaviour via “cancellation of the contract and  repossession of the vehicle”

Because you don’t want to repair it 

You disgust me I don’t have enough words to say how much your business practice has destroyed my life 
With all of the stress I had a stroke 
You knew my wife is really poorly and you still used against me as you knew I needed the car to take her to Christie’s for her cancer treatment 
So thank you for taking what should of been time spent with my wife enjoying what time we had left together and destroying it 
I hope people read this and decide not to destroy there life as well

Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude.

They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy.

I give my debit card details to take the first payment for car insurance.

This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!


Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience.

If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud.

I note your reply to my complaint asking me to call or email quoting the reference TP0272. Just spent 30 mins on the phone where none of your staff knew anything about this code or the complaint. Was this message just a stunt to try and make yourselves look better on trust pilot? I'm now going to email the address but I suspect just more of my time wasted!!!


Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to leave a review - we're really sorry to hear about your brother’s experience. We'd like to look into the matter further for you both and for you to have an opportunity to discuss your concerns in more detail. If you’d be happy to do this, please call us on 0333 321 6060, or email us at customer.enquiries at closebrothers.com, quoting the reference TP0272. Thank you

Beware of using this company. My brother was a victim of fraud and acted as a witness so a prosecution could be brought against the car dealer who committed the fraud. Close Brothers thanks to my brother is to hold the debt on his credit report and to be completely unhelpful when trying to resolve the issue.  Now having to employ a solicitor to get them to speak to us. I'm being over generous with 1 star!!!"	1
Never ever trust this company they are…	"Never ever trust this company they are very devious under handed and completely untrustworthy 
You have lied,cheated,altered your own records to make yourselves look good to the ombudsman and the courts 
I have got some of the transcripts of the phone calls 
(Compleat fabrication of the truth )
Tried to make me look like I was intimidating your staff 
(You rang me I only answered the phone call)
You have made my life a living hell for over 24 months
You have made my life and my wife’s life unbearable through threatening behaviour via “cancellation of the contract and  repossession of the vehicle”
If I won’t return the vehicle 
Because you don’t want to repair it 

You disgust me I don’t have enough words to say how much your business practice has destroyed my life 
With all of the stress I had a stroke 
You knew my wife is really poorly and you still used against me as you knew I needed the car to take her to Christie’s for her cancer treatment 
So thank you for taking what should of been time spent with my wife enjoying what time we had left together and destroying it 
I hope people read this and decide not to destroy there life as well

Great	Can’t understand the negative reviews... these guys have been great, very helpful when I call with queries and documentation always sent promptly!  Seamless process	5
Close Brothers Finance - impossible to get in touch with	Close Brothers Finance has undoubtedly one of the worst customer services I've ever dealt with - if you don't have your reference number on you , you're pretty much never going to get in contact with them and the girl I did get was quite rude. They also have no problem charging you late fees * but when they are late to the out a payment we don't get any money back? Absolute scammers.	1
AVOID!!! CLOSE BROTHERS ARE THE WORST FINANCE COMPANY OUT THERE!! CROOKS!!	Do not use close brothers they are the worst scammers ever, the worst finance company you can use. They will try to rob extort you whenever given the chance. I will never be using these bunch of cowboys again. I have never had a problem with any other finance company when it has come to my insurance policy. But however they think it is fine to take a higher amount when my insurance quote was recalculated and dropped substantially. Ended up just paying it off in full so these slime balls don't take any more money off	1
*ATENTION*	"*ATENTION*
I've help a friend of mine sort the car insurance with this group.
I give my debit card details to take the first payment for car insurance.
My surprise was when I realised after 2months they can not take payments from my friend account soo they used my card details to take the payments from my personal account. This was a MASSIVE abuse of trust. I've contacted my bank and they sort it out but checked my credit score I noticed I have in my account one report with £575 to pay. Completely SCAM. I'll report everywhere and make the most complaints I can do.
Unfortunately Trustpilot dont allow -10stars😡
Pay very attention."	1
WARNING!!	"WARNING!!
DO NOT USE CLOSE BROTHERS.
I wish I had read the reviews before dealing with them. Absolute ruthless company that has no morals nor do they care about individuals."	1
WARNING	WARNING. Stay well clear of this finance company. They have no idea what that are doing. I settled my agreement, but they kept saying it wasn’t settled and I needed to keep paying hundreds. Every advisor made up a different amount. It’s like they just think of a number on the spot. Gone through hell with this company so I advise others to stay well clear.	1

High prices, poor services	"Please consider carefully before taking out credit agreement with this company.
Poor service, high prices, conflicting information provided, wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy."	1
AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE	They do not refund large deposits (£400), even though I was only with them for 14 days. Appalling company, vile service and I’ve contacted the financial ombudsman to make sure I get my refund. I had my COVID jab and was working as a keyworker so couldn’t get my documents sent in time under stress. Horrible company. Adamant of their position and unwilling to help.	1

Waste of Space scammers	i have just had a direct debit set up on my bank by these scammers I have no idea who they are and their contact details are not visible. I have cancelled the DB as luckily I keep a close eye on my bank with this all these waste of space scammers out there we need to be alert.	1

Take your money and disregard you. As for chatting to anyone who isn't reading from pre written answers, well speak to more than one and you will understand.

Good luck speaking to complaints as once you are put through the line goes dead, this has happened a fair few times.

I cant help but think missing a payment is the quickest way for you to speak to anyone from this company.

All in all, an awful company to deal with.
Not helpful, offer no solutions and you cant even make a complaint to them as they cut you off."	1
Awful experience	"Awful experience. 
Consistently lied to and left in limbo.
Fully paid off HP and it still remains as outstanding. 

Same script read from phone operators and ""no management"" available for conversations. 

Avoid."	1
Very disappointing	"Having paid off HP on a car i then went to sell said car two weeks later. This car still showed as HP outstanding. I then spent two days trying to get confirmation of the HP as being paid off via email. Spoke with 4 different people and received nothing. I then managed to twice get through to the complaints department only to be cut off each time. 

As it currently stands Close Brothers have said they cant do anything at present and i will have to wait 48 hours.

So all in all, its been a very disappointing experience from the top to the bottom and i am left with a fully paid off car that after two weeks and a few days is still showing as HP outstanding."	1
Stupid website	"The website is terrible for longer than 7 years (when I used it for the first time). 
I put username and password, then another question, every time I put correct answer, but it says it's wrong and then there's no chance to reset your log in details. 
There is a button ""reset your password"", but it's useless for ages!
The website is terrible and very poor!"	1
